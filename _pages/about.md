I am currently a postdoc in Computer Science and Engineering in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) supervised by [Amir Goharshady](https://amir.goharshady.com/).
Before that, I was a PhD student (2019-2024) in the same department supervised by [Prof. Fangzhen Lin](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/flin).
I received the BS degree in Software Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in 2019 advised by [Prof. Hai Wan](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2550).
I am interested in formal method, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.
